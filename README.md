# ShadowBot
A Discord bot for Shadow Hunters

# Requirements
Before running the bot, make sure that Python3 is installed on your computer: https://realpython.com/installing-python/
To see which version of Python3 you have, open a terminal (look for cmd.exe if you run on Windows) and just type

```bash
python3
```

If your version of Python is at least 3.7.X, everything should work fine. Just in case, though, be sure to download the latest version of Python.


Then, you need to install the Python library discord.py. A tutorial is available here: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html

# Download

The simplest way is to use the "Download ZIP" button on top of this page, and then extract it somewhere on your computer, but this means that you will have redownload manually each time there is an update.
If you know how to use git, just clone the repository, and you should be able to update everything with a pull each time an update is available.

# Keys


# Run the bot

Simpler solution: double click the bot.bat file.

Other solution: open a terminal, use the cd command to go in the directory where you cloned/extracted the repo, and then:
```python
python3 bot_LPDA.py
```

If you have done everything correctly, a terminal should appear with a message saying
```bash
We have logged in as ShadowBot X.X.X#1011
```
